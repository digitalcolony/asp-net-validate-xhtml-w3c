# Validate Web Page with W3C (`ASP.NET`)

`ASP.NET` code to validate web page for XHTML with the W3C validator.

This code sends a URL to the W3C validator. If the page validates against the DOCTYPE it returns VALID. Otherwise it returns INVALID.

Although this tool is less useful than going directly to the W3C Validator site, I was able to use this code to test over 1,000 pages at once and then alert me to the pages that needed attention.
